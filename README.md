## Welcome to Calculator-GUI!
This is simply a basic calculator that runs on Windows platforms. 

So far, the following features have been implemented: 

 - Basic Calculations 
 - Negative Numbers can be entered via toggle
 - Outputs of previous calculations are stored for easier calculations
 - Memory can be cleared via CLR button
 
 More features to come! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Also, we don't talk about the tags... I realized the . following v was redundant and fixed it, but I can't figure out how to remove the pushed tags, so it'll have to stay I guess.
